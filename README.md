# LogDown.
* LogDown is a Single Page Web Application built using MEAN stack (Mongo, Express, Angular, Node).
* A registered user of the application can view the calorie content and other macros like protein, fats and sugar content in a 
  particular food item.
 * A user can create a food log. In each food log, he can add the food items that he has consumed during that day.
 * An option is provided for the user to add the food item in either breakfast, lunch, dinner or snacks category in each food log.
 * The searching of food items and the displaying their macros is done by hitting the Nutrionix API.
 * An anonymous user (user without an account) can view the macros and calorie content in a food item but cannot add it to his foodlog unless he creates an account.
